- Customizable Ringtone: The app plays a realistic ringtone when a fake call is triggered.
- Realistic UI: Displays a convincing incoming call screen, allowing users to either answer or reject the call.
- Silent Mode: The app can mute the call or play it with the ringtone, based on user preferences.
- Automatic Looping: Calls can be triggered multiple times without needing to reset the app.
- Smooth and Modern UI: Designed with SwiftUI, the interface is clean and user-friendly.
- Volume Button Control: Utilizes the device's hardware buttons to discreetly initiate a fake call.
